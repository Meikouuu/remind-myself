# remind-myself


~~"I'm just reminding myself in the future"~~





hello, myself in the future.
```js
"
Today is bad, tomorrow will be good. no one knows the future But we know how to overcome the present.
Every day is not always bad. On bad days, good things happen in this earth.
Be yourself And keep in mind that success is not just about being rich, but that success is in mind.
The coin has two sides. It was like the person.
