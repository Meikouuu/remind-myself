# remind-myself





hello, myself in the future.
```js
"
Today is bad, tomorrow will be good. no one knows the future But we know how to overcome the present.
Every day is not always bad. On bad days, good things happen in this earth.
Be yourself And keep in mind that success is not just about being rich, but that success is in mind.
The coin has two sides. It was like the person.
Evil is always in your heart and there is no way to get rid of it.
Loneliness can't kill you.
